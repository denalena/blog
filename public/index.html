		When I started this blog, I wanted to make a post of how I set it up. Now comes is the time! Although I have to say, I kind of forgot what my pain points were back then, but I remember that I tried using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, and with both of them I wasn&rsquo;t happy.
What I wanted was:
publishing by git posts as markdown a simple way to preview posts before publishing My solution now is using Hugo, another popular static site generator written in go.

		Whenever I&rsquo;m inside and I hear rain, it&rsquo;s really calming to me. Even storms manage to bring me peace. Sometimes, when I have difficulties to sleep, and it&rsquo;s not coincidentally raining outside, I might turn on some noise source. There are infinite options to choose from of course: iOS has it built in, there is airplane ambient noise readily available on Spotify and YouTube, and one of my favorites is the &ldquo;Rain on a Tent&rdquo; preset on mynoise.

	<b><time>17.11.2022</time></b>
	
	<div>
		When working with a PHP codebase I really like to use XDebug as a way to find my way around and getting a grasp on what&rsquo;s going on.
One thing that annoyed me a bit was that in order to inspect return values of methods, I had to assign them to a dedicated variable. This doesn&rsquo;t sound like a problem, but there can be a bunch of reasons why you don&rsquo;t want to change the code for this.

		hello world,
my name is Deniz :D and so far I spent an uncomfortably amount of time with computers and the internet during my life and it seems like that is not likely to change anytime soon.
In the past I had several blogs. Sometimes on blogspot, sometimes self-hosted Wordpress instances, and sometimes something entirely different. But they all have one thing in common: they are lost in the sands of time.
