		So, it has been 3 months since I started this blog and I haven&rsquo;t been very active yet, but there are some posts in the pipeline I swear.
When I started this blog, I wanted to make a post of how I set it up. Now comes is the time! Although I have to say, I kind of forgot what my pain points were back then, but I remember that I tried using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, and with both of them I wasn&rsquo;t happy.

	<h1><a href="https://ledeniz.github.io/blog/posts/2022-11-16-xdebug/">Inspect return values with XDebug</a></h1>
	<b><time>2022-11-16 21:57:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		When working with a PHP codebase I really like to use XDebug as a way to find my way around and getting a grasp on what&rsquo;s going on.
One thing that annoyed me a bit was that in order to inspect return values of methods, I had to assign them to a dedicated variable. This doesn&rsquo;t sound like a problem, but there can be a bunch of reasons why you don&rsquo;t want to change the code for this.

		hello world,
my name is Deniz :D and so far I spent an uncomfortably amount of time with computers and the internet during my life and it seems like that is not likely to change anytime soon.
In the past I had several blogs. Sometimes on blogspot, sometimes self-hosted Wordpress instances, and sometimes something entirely different. But they all have one thing in common: they are lost in the sands of time.
