				<p>When I started this blog, I wanted to make a post of how I set it up. Now comes is the time! Although I have to say, I kind of forgot what my pain points were back then, but I remember that I tried using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, and with both of them I wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
<p>What I wanted was:</p>
<ul>
<li>publishing by git</li>
<li>posts as markdown</li>
<li>a simple way to preview posts before publishing</li>
</ul>
<p>My solution now is using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, another popular static site generator written in go. I really like the setup because it&rsquo;s quite simple to get started. Basically the steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/">Install Hugo</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">create a site</a></li>
<li>This creates a directory containing all the files; create a git repo and push it to GitHub</li>
<li>Set GitHub Actions as the source for GitHub Pages in the repo settings</li>
<li>Add the Hugo workflow by GitHub Actions</li>
</ul>
<p>And you&rsquo;re done! Now you can use <code>hugo</code> to build the site, and if you commit and push the changes, the site gets updated. This includes editing blog posts in GitHub directly. Also, <code>hugo server</code> can be used to easily serve the content locally to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>Note that your repo has to be public if you don&rsquo;t want to pay for using GitHub Pages. I still have to figure out some configuration and a nice theme, but this is a nice way to go forward.</p>
<p>By the way, I noticed that it&rsquo;s way easier for me to just sit down and write/draft blog posts in the note taking tool of my choice (which is currently <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>) instead of worrying about how the blog works.</p>
