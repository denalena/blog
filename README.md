# blog
My blog. I summarized it's purpose [here](https://ledeniz.github.io/blog/posts/2022-11-16-about/).

Readable at [blog.ledeniz.de](https://blog.ledeniz.de/)
(or browse the markdown files in [/content/posts](https://github.com/ledeniz/blog/tree/main/content/posts))

It gets built and deployed by the Hugo workflow for GitHub Pages, [I wrote a bit about it](https://ledeniz.github.io/blog/posts/2023-02-16-hugo/).
