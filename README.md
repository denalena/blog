# blog
My blog. I summarized it's purpose [here](https://blog.denalena.de/posts/2022-11-16-about/).

Readable at [blog.denalena.de](https://blog.denalena.de/)
(or browse the markdown files in [/content/posts](https://github.com/denalena/blog/tree/main/content/posts))

This used to get built via the GitHub Hugo workflow but it broke and I didn't bother to fix it, instead I utilize the fallback of uploading the generated HTML myself.
