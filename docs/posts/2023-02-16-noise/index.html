			<h1>Make some noise!</h1>

				<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m inside and I hear rain, it&rsquo;s really calming to me. Even storms manage to bring me peace. Sometimes, when I have difficulties to sleep, and it&rsquo;s not coincidentally raining outside, I might turn on some noise source. There are infinite options to choose from of course: iOS has it built in, there is airplane ambient noise readily available on Spotify and YouTube, and one of my favorites is the &ldquo;Rain on a Tent&rdquo; preset on <a href="https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/campingRainNoiseGenerator.php">mynoise.net</a>.Â </p>
<p>On the other hand, during the day I noticed that the microphone of one of my co-workers has quite the high noise floor, and every time they unmute themselves in a call, I immediately start feeling a little more comfy because of that noise. Not long after that, I saw <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/11/14/brown-noise-adhd-focus/">an article</a> floating around <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33685567#33690209">on HN</a> about how listening to the low rumble brown noise could help calming the mind.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, brown noise is static noise where you mostly hear the lower frequencies, I recommend reading the article to learn more about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I just feel like my brain is being hugged&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That article was a nice read, but as usual on HN, the real treasure is found in the comments. And I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed this time as well, something piqued my interest: a discussion emerged about how people like to play noise <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33687737">from their command line</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This also helps cover up constant early morning construction and traffic. If I can help it I just use: play -n synth brown on any linux system with sox installed&hellip; it&rsquo;s definitely the cleanest sound I&rsquo;ve found.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this was quite the revelation to me. I really like to speed up my workflows because it minimizes the chance that I get distracted, and being able to fire up some concentrating noise in a quick way is really valuable to me. Also I really like that it&rsquo;s generated on the fly. So I listened to the different presets that people created and gathered the ones that sound the nicest to me, and here they are:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>play -n -c 5 synth brown vol -17dB
        
play -n -n --combine merge synth brownnoise band -n 550 550 vol -17dB
        
play -n -n --combine merge synth &#39;24:00:00&#39; brownnoise band -n 750 750 tremolo 50 1 vol -17dB
        
play -c 2 --null synth brownnoise reverb bass 6 treble -3
        
play -c 2 --null synth brownnoise reverb bass 10 treble -6

play -n -n --combine merge synth brownnoise band -n 550 550 tremolo 50 1 vol -17dB reverb bass 10 treble -6

play -n -n --combine merge synth brownnoise band -n 150 150 tremolo 50 1 reverb bass 10 treble -6
</code></pre><p>Note that I added <code>vol -17dB</code> to almost all of them to make them a bit quieter by default. It&rsquo;s quite fun to experiment with the different options available and to find comfy settings for oneself. I usually go with the last one, and have it readily available in a <code>noise.sh</code> that is in a directory from my <code>$PATH</code>. Also, I bound it to the keystroke <code>ctrl+n</code> via my <code>.inputrc</code>.</p>
<p>I find myself to run this quite frequently now during work and I&rsquo;m really thankful for finding out about it, so here I am, spreading the noise.</p>
