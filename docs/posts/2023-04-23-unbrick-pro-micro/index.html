Currently I specifically like to use the <a href=https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640>Sparkfun ProMicro</a>, because of it&rsquo;s on-board USB capabilities (more on that in a future blog post).</p><p><figure><img src=breadboard.jpg alt="A photo of a Pro Micro development board plugged into a breadboard, with a push button jammed into the reset pin"></figure>(yeah, it&rsquo;s a cheap clone I got from <a href=https://archive.is/I7Rhd>aliexpress</a>)</p><p>While setting up my Arduino IDE and playing around with it, I noticed that there are several ways that you can end up in a situation that makes it difficult to flash a new sketch to the board. In such states, your OS may report that a USB device wasn&rsquo;t recognized and the serial port may not show up in the Arduino IDE, which lets the board turn into a tiny <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)>brick</a>.</p><p>Luckily there is an official guide for resolving that issue on <a href=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide#ts-revive>learn.sparkfun.com</a>:</p><blockquote><p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to set the serial port to the bootloader. <strong>But that port is only visible when the board is in bootloader mode</strong>, so pull the reset line low twice quickly to invoke the bootloader reset feature discussed above. On Pro Micro&rsquo;s, or other devices which don&rsquo;t have a reset button, you can either use a wire to quickly short &lsquo;RST&rsquo; to &lsquo;GND&rsquo; twice, or wire up a temporary reset button. While the Pro Micro is in the bootloader change the &lsquo;Tools > Serial Port&rsquo; menu to the bootloader COM port. <strong>Quick! You&rsquo;ve only got eight seconds.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Maybe I&rsquo;m getting old, but I just can&rsquo;t get it done in time. Not only do I have to re-select the port but also the board itself from a search dialog. It&rsquo;s mind-boggling to me why the Arduino IDE doesn&rsquo;t let you specify those settings beforehand. You could argue that I&rsquo;m not only using an unofficial Arduino dev board but also a cheap clone of it, and you&rsquo;re totally right! But I experienced similar issues before, even with an official <a href=https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-micro>Arduino Micro</a>. Also, the IDE <em>always</em> recompiles the sketch before flashing it. The farthest I got was getting it to begin the flashing process, only to reach the eight second window right in the middle of it, which of course aborts the whole thing.</p><p><figure><img src=arduino-ide.png alt="A screenshot of the enabled verbosity settings in the Arduino IDE"></figure></p><p>I enabled more verbose output of the flashing step to maybe find a more useful error message, and indeed I got lucky: I spotted the exact command that is run to flash the compiled sketch. By just running that myself in a terminal, I was able to flash the board instantly after I put it into the bootloader mode by just hitting the enter key of my keyboard instead of competing in a speedrun point&rsquo;n&rsquo;click challenge against the clock.</p><p>I published a repository containing a small script, with the needed <code>avrdude</code> configuration and an compiled empty sketch, in case someone needs this as well (I&rsquo;m sure I will!): <a href=https://github.com/denalena/unbrick-promicro>https://github.com/denalena/unbrick-promicro</a></p><p>Also, now I&rsquo;m thinking about switching over again to using <a href=https://platformio.org/>PlatformIO</a> instead of the Arduino IDE. But apart from the weird behavior this blog post is about, for now it still works okay enough for me and I still have some bad memories from using PlatformIO in the past.</p><p>P.S. While writing this blog post I listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3baH5iTcFM">this rendition</a> of the Twin Peaks theme played on that very board visible above in the photo. I don&rsquo;t know the show, but the tune is pretty relaxing. And it sure is satisfying to let the little board put out some <a href=https://github.com/blakelivingston/DuinoTune/>magic</a> :></p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/posts/2025-02-05-platformio/>Dedicated VSCode config for PlatformIO</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2024-07-05-usb-boot-selector/>USB boot selector</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2024-07-01-platformio/>Selective sketch building with PlatformIO</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2023-04-23-unbrick-pro-micro/>How to unbrick a Pro Micro clone (fast)</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2023-02-16-hugo/>Running a blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://blog.denalena.de/><b>thoughts of a deer</b></a>.</p></footer></body></html>
