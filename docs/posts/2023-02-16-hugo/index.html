The time has come! Although I have to say, I kind of forgot what my pain points were initially, but I remember that I tried using &ldquo;pure&rdquo; GitHub Pages and Jekyll, and with both of them I wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p><p>What I wanted was:</p><ul><li>publishing by git</li><li>posts as markdown</li><li>a simple way to preview posts and the blog before publishing</li></ul><p>My solution now is using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, another popular static site generator written in go. I really like the setup because it&rsquo;s quite simple to get started and to maintain. Basically the steps to get going are:</p><ul><li><a href=https://gohugo.io/installation/>Install Hugo</a> and <a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/>create a site</a></li><li>This creates a directory containing all the files; create a git repo and push it to GitHub</li><li>Set GitHub Actions as the source for GitHub Pages in the repo settings</li><li>Add the Hugo workflow by GitHub Actions</li></ul><p>And you&rsquo;re done! Now you can use <code>hugo</code> to build the site, and if you commit and push the changes, the site gets updated. This includes editing blog posts in GitHub directly. Also, <code>hugo server</code> can be used to easily serve the content locally to get a feel for it or creating/editing themes.</p><p>Note that your repo has to be public if you don&rsquo;t want to pay for using GitHub Pages. I still have to figure out some configuration and a nice theme, but this is a nice way to go forward.</p><p>By the way, I noticed that it&rsquo;s way easier for me to just sit down and write/draft blog posts in the note taking tool of my choice (which is currently <a href=https://joplinapp.org/>Joplin</a>) instead of worrying about how the blog works.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/posts/2025-02-05-platformio/>Dedicated VSCode config for PlatformIO</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2024-07-05-usb-boot-selector/>USB boot selector</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2024-07-01-platformio/>Selective sketch building with PlatformIO</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2023-04-23-unbrick-pro-micro/>How to unbrick a Pro Micro clone (fast)</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2023-02-16-hugo/>Running a blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://blog.denalena.de/><b>thoughts of a deer</b></a>.</p></footer></body></html>
